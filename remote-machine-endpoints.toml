# Remote machine endpoints: machine_id -> OpenAI-compatible base URL.
#
# Channel of communication: Tailscale only. Each machine publishes its Tailscale IP
# (base_url = "http://<tailscale-ip>:1234/v1") via dotfiles tailscale-publish-endpoints
# at boot. No ngrok is used for this repo.
#
# Section name = output of dotfiles/scripts/machine-user-id.sh (uname|hostname|user|cpu|gpu).
# Same key as ~/.config/lmstudio-remote.toml. For lookup: run that script on the target
# machine to get its key, then use that key in credentials and in REMOTE_MACHINE_ID.
